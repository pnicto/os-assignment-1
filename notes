TASKS
All of them

OTHER WORK
Figure out which of the header files in client.h are/aren't needed
Error handling for user inputing non numbers in client.c
Update message buffer mtext array size after the code that uses it is written, if it seems too large/too small
Add cleanup work in error handling (clients should try ask server to remove their client id if it was added before, server should try delete message queue if it has already been made)

MESSAGE QUEUE MTYPES
1-9: for sending messages to server:
  1: termination request from cleanup.c
  2: creation request for new client
  3: client deletion
  4-6: client reqeusts of types 1-3 respectively
11+: to send a message to client with id n, use mtype n + 10

NOTES
until we get the message queue deletion code in place, run `ipcrm --all=msg` after closing the server every time to manually delete the queue
